# Home_Security
Home security project using an ESP8266 as a web server

A note on versions: 

V1 is scratched

V2 uses an external website hosted on firebase as control panel. This required a secure https connection to esp8266 which made it slow, esp is not good for SSL cryptography. 

V3 hosts the webpage on esp server. A lot easier to work with than V2.
